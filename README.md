Speedfreak Custom is a personal project of mine designed ONLY to work on my own installation.

## Installation

Sorry, due to the nature of this project, it's not meant for distributed use. Go look somewhere else for a better and more general theme. It's literally only built to work with my own webpage and nothing else.

## What if I get it to work anyways?

More power to you, and godspeed.
